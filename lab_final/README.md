# Lab Final - Visual cortex decoding (mind reading)

Image enhancement and segmentation using mathematical approaches. (deep learning techniques may produce better results)

## Step 1

**Implement a non-local denoising algorithm such as bilateral filtering, non-local means or a denoising autoencoder, estimate SNR and test your algorithm on the images provided. Do not call functions from libraries such as `scipy` or `dipy`.**

Write sth here.

## Step 2

**Implement a segmentation algorithm such as Otsuâ€™s method, watershed transform, region growing, mean-shift clustering and graph-cut, or a neural network model. Test on the images provided and comment on the performance. Do not call functions from libraries such as `scipy` or `dipy`.**
