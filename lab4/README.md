Image enhancement and segmentation using both mathematical approaches and deep learning techniques.

## Part 1: image enhancement - denoising

**Implement a non-local denoising algorithm such as bilateral filtering, non-local means or a denoising autoencoder, estimate SNR and test your algorithm on the images provided. Do not call functions from libraries such as `scipy` or `dipy`.**

## Part 2: image segmentation

**Implement a segmentation algorithm such as Otsuâ€™s method, watershed transform, region growing, mean-shift clustering and graph-cut, or a neural network model. Test on the images provided and comment on the performance. Do not call functions from libraries such as `scipy` or `dipy`.**
